Welcome to my program!

The only command needed to use this program is typing in artist's names.
These searches are case sensitive, and are ran through a python library connected
to Spotify.

The base of the queries is set to 'artists', so if a user enters a song, its possible
that search results would contain that particular result, but would be catered more to
the similarities between the query and the artist, as opposed to the query and other tracks.
For this reason, it is best to restrict searches to artists.

In order to have the program work as intended, try to avoid special characters,
check spelling, and make sure your search is case sensitive. 

To quit the program, simply type 'quit'.
